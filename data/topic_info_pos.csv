I have been taking 5mg for six weeks and have just increased to 10mg starting today. My doctor added Wellbutrin SR 150mg to help with the depression. Abilify does well for the manic episodes but did not help the depression. I hope this increased dosage of Abilify and Wellbutrin does the trick.', 'Since i started taking Abilify i feel great...', 'I have been on abilify for 2 months, I am also taking venlafaxine XR for my severe depression, I am currently taking 10 mg of abilify and I am doing fine at the dosage.
